<p>I hold a 1st Class BSc Honours Mathematics Degree and Enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. I have been teaching for 10+ years and teach online via Zoom and an interactive whiteboard. I teach up to GCSE level and I specialise in all UK exam boards.</p>

<p>Let me take you on my journey. I first came to love numbers when I was in secondary school. I finished my work before everyone in my class so the teacher asked me to go around the classroom helping others. By explaining how to answer questions to others I gained further understanding myself. I went on to achieve an A* in my Maths GCSE.</p>

<p>After University I had various office based roles. These roles did not make use of my mathematics degree so I became a teaching assistant at a secondary school in the maths department. Immediately, I felt at home; explaining to students how to answer questions felt great and made good use of my maths degree.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the interesting part. I fell into becoming a private maths tutor completely by accident. I applied for a maths tutoring job via an agency. I went for the interview and was successful. However the agency closed so I was left without the job. I decided to go it alone and create my own tutoring business. When I got my first client I was over the moon. Going to visit this one client was one of my weekly highlights. From there, word of mouth took over. I started getting referrals as a result of my first student achieving their target grade. And here we are today. I am currently an international online maths tutor with students based all over the world!</p>
