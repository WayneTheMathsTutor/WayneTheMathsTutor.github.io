	<p class="testimony">Hi Wayne, hope youâ€™re well. J mentioned this afternoon that you asked for feedback on the lessons. I must to say that your teaching is fun and engaging. I definitely prefer the group lesson and feel that it works perfectly for J. She is more confident working with other kids and tries to give every question a go. There is always something new / different she hasnâ€™t come across and I believe that she benefits a lot from your tuition and the variety of questions. I hope that you also enjoy group learning and itâ€™s working well for you. <span class="author">Marta G (Parent)</span></p>

	<p class="testimony">My son was struggling with his maths. I found Wayne after asking for private tutors on a community page. Wayne got in touch and my son had around 8 months of private tutor lessons all online at home which were brilliant. My son was at grade 3 level. GCSE results day yesterday and my son achieved the grade 5 he wanted and needed. Thank you to Wayne for his patience and help really appreciated. Would highly recommend. <span class="author">Mrs Louise H (Parent)</span></p>

	<p class="testimony">We had Jâ€™s Year 10 parents evening yesterday and his maths teacher was really impressed with his increased confidence in maths. She said his test results have really improved recently and she feels he has a greater understanding of the topic areas than heâ€™s had in previous years. So just wanted to say thank you! Iâ€™m hoping you can keep putting up with J until he finishes his GCSEs as heâ€™s going to need your help more than ever in Year 11! <span class="author">Mrs Jane B (Parent)</span></p>

	<p class="testimony">My son was initially struggling with GCSE Maths, achieving borderline C/D grades for homework after being predicted a low C grade. Following additional tutoring with Wayne for 2-3 months, he successfully achieved Grade B at GCSE Level and has started A-Level Maths.

We would certainly use Wayneâ€™s services again. <span class="author">Mr Rob B (Parent)</p>
